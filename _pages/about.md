Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), co-advised by [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/), [Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/), and [Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/). My research interests lie in the foundations of generative AI, and its applications to producing immersive video/3D content.

I love cats, coffee (especially lattes), video games, cooking, and playing baseball. I enjoy learning new things beyond my research area.

If you are interested in collaboration or would like to learn more about my research, please connect:
