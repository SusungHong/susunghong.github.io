Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), co-advised by [Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/), [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/), and [Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/). My research interests lie in the foundations of generative AI, and its applications to creating immersive video/3D content.
