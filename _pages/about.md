Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), co-advised by [Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/), [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/), and [Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/).

I ultimately aim to create a better clone of our world capable of incubating intelligence, with a dual focus on visual and symbolic knowledge. To this end, I am currently interested in scalable generative models, large datasets, and their potential to construct sophisticated and interactive environments.
